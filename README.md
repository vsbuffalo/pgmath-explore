# Population Genetics Math Exploration

These are my notes on the mathematics of some population genetics
papers I enjoyed or where applicable to projects I am working on. In
some cases I go on tangents and user other texts to explain a topic to
myself.

**Ccaveat emptor**: there may be errors in my equations, typesetting,
  or logic (or perhaps even all at once!). Use these notes with
  caution. If you find an error in my reasoning, feel free to send me
  a pull request or email at vsbuffaloAAAA@gmail.com (sans poly-A
  tail).
